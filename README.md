# The Guardian News App 

My first angular 2 app which makes use of the <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/">API of The Guardian</a>

## Run the app

Clone the repo

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
