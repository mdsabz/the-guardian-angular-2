# The Guardian News App 

My first angular 2 (based upon the <a href="https://github.com/angular/quickstart" target="_blank">Angular 2 QuickStart</a>) app which makes use of the <a href="http://open-platform.theguardian.com/" target="_blank">API of The Guardian</a>

## Run the app

Clone the repo

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**Attention Windows Developers:  You must run all of these commands in administrator mode**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
